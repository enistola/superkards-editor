# Superkards

Superkards is a website template editor I built for learning purposes. It is the first project I ever build on my own - with (at that time) limited programming knowledge.

See a live demo here: [Live Demo](https://superkards-editor.netlify.app/)

## Tech stack

It is a vanilla javascript project that utilizes webpack as a module bundler.

## Run the app

Switch into directory with `cd superkards-editor` and run `npm start`. It will automatically open on localhost:8080
